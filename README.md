# Compare

I was thinking on what language to choose when writing up this exercise. There are a few options. One being in Java
since that is what the job I am applying for. But I choose to go a different direction. I choose to write this
exercise in JavaScript. JavaScript is easy to mock up a simple function and to run. Also give a quick test bed to
test it as well to make sure it is working properly. And it would not take much to move it over to a Java Applet.

## Getting Started

This is a simple function that writen up in javascript for a code review.

### Prerequisites

You need a web browser that has a debugger/console.

## Running the tests

To run code please use browser debug mode and in the console type compare() and pass in the strings you like to
compare. Please include "" around the numbers.

ex compare("1.8.0", "2.3.0") then return and it will return a value string.
