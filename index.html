    I was thinking on what language to choose when writing up this exercise. There are a few options. One being in Java
    since that is what the job I am applying for. But I choose to go a different direction. I choose to write this
    exercise in JavaScript. JavaScript is easy to mock up a simple function and to run. Also give a quick test bed to
    test it as well to make sure it is working properly. And it would not take much to move it over to a Java Applet.
    <br /><br />
    To run code please use browser debug mode and in the console type compare() and pass in the strings you like to
    compare. Please include "" around the numbers.
    <br />
    ex compare("1.8.0", "2.3.0") then return and it will return a value string.
